# Express API Project
Netflix API built in Node using Express. The assignment was to get an introduction to backend and creating an API using Express. The requirements was to create at least a couple of RESTful endpoints.

## The problem

I used the array method filter() and includes() to get the result I wanted. 

The following endpoints are available: 
/shows & /titles/title & year/year & cast/cast & genre/listed_in & country/country&type=Movie or TV Show

I used a query to choose the type movie or TV Show in a certain country.

If I had more time I would have built a frontend page for this as well as more querys.
